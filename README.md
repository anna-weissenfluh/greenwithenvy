Grace Cavitt and Anna Weissenfluh both attend Madison Academic Magnet High School. We had both worked on the same page at the same time. Each of us had done different tasks each time. Some days I worked on the pictures, and Grace would work on the text. Some days we would both work on the carousel, or one would work on the carousel and the other the footer. One of the problems we had to overcome was our procrastination. There would be days where we wouldn't want to do too much. The last two weeks we had to do the project, we had to be very on task. I personally discovered how much more I love to code. My interest in coding has increased from what it was before.
